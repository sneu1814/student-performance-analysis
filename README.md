# Student Performance Analysis using Python

Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance data using Python. The objective is to explore factors affecting students' final grades through data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

Analysis Performed
- Calculated average scores (G1, G2, G3)
- Analyzed impact of study time on final grades
- Compared performance across gender
- Visualized grade distribution and performance patterns

Key Insights
- Higher study time is associated with better final grades
- Students with fewer failures perform better
- Grade distribution shows most students scoring between 8–14

Dataset
- Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
- Dataset: Student Performance (student-mat.csv)
